# GCP Partner Specialisation - Machine Learning
## Capability assesment - Demo #2

### Assignment
Demonstration of an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline exploiting the [Black Friday dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abhisingh10p14/black-friday) to solve a Kaggle challenge.


### Code implementation
The architecture flow of the solution is fivefold:
- data exploration
- data validation
- modelling
- evaluation
- model deployment

To do so, run in this order the following notebooks:
1. EDA & Feature selection
2. __TODO__: Update with new notebooks

#### Train data - EDA & Feature selection
This notebook makes the initial sanity checks and runs a SweetViz profiling on the original training data.  

Engineering and selection of features is discussed here.  

This notebook also makes the same sanity checks and profiling as before on the original test data.


### Report
The technical whitepaper can be found [here TODO](TODO).
