- 1. Sanity Checks & EDA #1: Contains analysis of the original dataset and feature engineering.
- 2. EDA #2 & Feature Selection: Contains analysis of the feature engineered dataset.
- 3. Data validation: Uses TFDV to analyse the data created by TFX.
- 4. Model evaluation: Used TFMA to analyse the model created by TFX.
- 5. Model deployment testing: Tests the deployed model with a simple query.

## Running the code

There is a notebook deployed on Vertex AI Workbench with the name of [demo1notebook.](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/list/instances?authuser=3&project=aliz-ml-spec-2022-submission) that has all of the Jupyter Notebooks and code available.
